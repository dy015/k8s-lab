# Kubernetes Break & Fix Workshop - Overview

## Welcome to the Workshop!

This hands-on workshop teaches Kubernetes troubleshooting through practical experience. You'll deploy a real 3-tier application and systematically break and repair it through 15 progressive exercises.

## Workshop Philosophy

**"The best way to learn troubleshooting is by troubleshooting."**

Instead of passive learning, you'll:
- Deploy real applications
- Encounter real problems
- Use real debugging tools
- Develop real troubleshooting skills

## What You'll Build

A complete 3-tier web application called **TaskMaster**:
- **Frontend**: Responsive web dashboard (nginx)
- **Backend**: RESTful API (Python Flask)
- **Database**: Persistent data store (PostgreSQL)

All deployed on Kubernetes with proper networking, storage, and ingress configuration.

## Workshop Structure

### Hour 0-1: Foundation
- Install k3s Kubernetes cluster
- Deploy baseline application
- Verify everything works
- Access the dashboard
- Understand the architecture

### Hour 1-3: Basic Issues (Exercises 01-05)
**Focus**: Pod-level problems

- Exercise 01: CrashLoopBackOff (misconfigured command)
- Exercise 02: ImagePullBackOff (wrong image tag)
- Exercise 03: Service Unreachable (selector mismatch)
- Exercise 04: ConfigMap Missing (deleted configuration)
- Exercise 05: Secret Missing (missing credentials)

**Skills**: kubectl basics, pod debugging, resource inspection

### Hour 3-6: Resource Management (Exercises 06-10)
**Focus**: Resource limits and probes

- Exercise 06: OOM Killed (memory limits)
- Exercise 07: Liveness Probe Fail (wrong health endpoint)
- Exercise 08: Readiness Probe Fail (probe timing)
- Exercise 09: PVC Pending (storage issues)
- Exercise 10: DNS Not Working (CoreDNS problems)

**Skills**: Resource management, health checks, storage, DNS troubleshooting

### Hour 6-10: Advanced Topics (Exercises 11-15)
**Focus**: Networking and operations

- Exercise 11: Ingress 404 (routing issues)
- Exercise 12: RBAC Forbidden (permission problems)
- Exercise 13: Network Policy Blocked (network segmentation)
- Exercise 14: Node Pressure (disk pressure)
- Exercise 15: Rollout Stuck (deployment updates)

**Skills**: Networking, security, node management, deployments

## Learning Methodology

Each exercise follows a consistent pattern:

### 1. Break (3-5 minutes)
Run `./break.sh` to introduce the issue
- Application breaks in a specific way
- You see the symptoms
- Dashboard shows the problem

### 2. Troubleshoot (10-15 minutes)
Use kubectl to investigate
- Check pod status
- Review events
- Examine logs
- Describe resources
- Find the root cause

### 3. Fix (5 minutes)
Apply the fix
- Manual fix (recommended for learning)
- Or use `./fix.sh` to see the solution
- Understand why it works

### 4. Verify (2-3 minutes)
Confirm the fix worked
- Run `./verify.sh`
- Check dashboard
- Test functionality
- Ensure everything is healthy

### 5. Reset (1-2 minutes)
Return to baseline
- Run `./reset.sh`
- Ready for next exercise
- Clean slate
